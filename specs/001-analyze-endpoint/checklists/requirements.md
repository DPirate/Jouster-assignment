# Specification Quality Checklist: Analyze Endpoint

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Content Quality**: ✅ PASS
- Specification describes WHAT the analyze endpoint does (accepts text, returns analysis) without mentioning implementation technologies
- Focus is on user needs (getting insights, handling errors, storing results)
- Language is accessible (e.g., "LLM service" instead of "Anthropic Claude API", "storage" instead of "SQLite")
- All mandatory sections present and complete

**Requirement Completeness**: ✅ PASS
- All 18 functional requirements are testable with clear pass/fail criteria
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are concrete and specific
- 10 success criteria defined with specific metrics (time limits, accuracy percentages, HTTP codes)
- 8 edge cases comprehensively identified (empty input, LLM failures, storage issues, special characters)
- Scope clearly bounded: POST /analyze endpoint with specific input/output format
- Dependencies identified: LLM service availability, storage system

**Feature Readiness**: ✅ PASS
- 4 user stories (submit text, handle invalid input, persist results, handle LLM failures) all map to functional requirements
- Stories are independently testable with clear Given-When-Then scenarios
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic:
  - ✅ "Users receive results in under 10 seconds" (not "API response time")
  - ✅ "System handles failures without crashing" (not "exception handling in code")
  - ✅ "Users can understand error messages" (not "error logging implementation")
- No implementation details leak into specification

## Overall Status

**✅ SPECIFICATION READY FOR PLANNING**

All checklist items pass. The specification is complete, testable, unambiguous, and ready for `/speckit.plan`.

### Strengths
- Comprehensive error handling scenarios covered
- Clear separation between LLM-based extraction and custom keyword extraction
- Well-defined data entities and their relationships
- Realistic success criteria with measurable metrics
- All 4 user stories are independently valuable (true MVP slicing)

### Notes
- Specification maintains technology independence while being specific about requirements
- Edge cases are realistic and cover common production scenarios
- HTTP status codes specified appropriately (200, 400, 500, 503, 504)
