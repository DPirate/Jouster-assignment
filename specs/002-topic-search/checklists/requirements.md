# Specification Quality Checklist: Topic Search Endpoint

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-23
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

All checklist items have been validated and passed:

1. **Content Quality**: Specification is written in business language without implementation details. It focuses on user needs (searching for relevant analyses) and business value (making the system searchable).

2. **Requirement Completeness**: All 13 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-013) are testable and unambiguous. No clarification markers needed - the feature scope is well-defined based on standard REST API search patterns.

3. **Success Criteria**: All 4 success criteria (SC-001 through SC-004) are measurable and technology-agnostic:
   - SC-001: Performance target (1 second for 10K records)
   - SC-002: Accuracy metrics (100% precision/recall)
   - SC-003: Concurrency handling (100 concurrent requests)
   - SC-004: Reliability metric (99.9% success rate)

4. **Feature Readiness**: All 4 user stories have clear acceptance scenarios with Given-When-Then format. Edge cases are documented. Scope is bounded with explicit "Out of Scope" section.

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan`
- No clarifications needed - feature builds naturally on existing POST /analyze endpoint
- Dependencies clearly identified (existing database schema, Analysis model)
