## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 2 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational phase - Can start after T014
- **User Story 3 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational phase - Can start after T014
- **User Story 4 (Phase 5)**: Depends on Foundational phase - Can start after T014
- **User Story 1 (Phase 6)**: Depends on US2, US3, US4 completion - Needs validation, persistence, and LLM integration
- **Concurrency (Phase 7)**: Depends on US1 completion
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all user stories complete

### User Story Dependencies

**Critical Path**:
```
Setup (T001-T005)
  ↓
Foundational (T006-T014) ← BLOCKING GATE
  ↓
├─ US2: Input Validation (T015-T020) ─┐
├─ US3: Persistence (T021-T026) ──────┤
└─ US4: LLM Handling (T027-T035) ─────┤
                                       ↓
                    US1: Core Analysis (T036-T045) ← MVP Complete
                                       ↓
                    Concurrency (T046-T049)
                                       ↓
                    Polish (T050-T056)
```

**US2 is independently testable**: After T020, can validate all error scenarios
**US3 is independently testable**: After T026, can test persistence (with mock data)
**US4 is independently testable**: After T035, can test LLM error handling (with mock endpoint)
**US1 requires US2, US3, US4**: Needs validation, persistence, and LLM to be complete

### Within Each User Story

**User Story 2** (Input Validation):
- T015 (validator) before T016 (error handler)
- T017-T020 (tests) can run in parallel after T016

**User Story 3** (Persistence):
- T021 (UUID) before T022 (save method)
- T023 (findById) parallel to T022
- T024-T026 (tests) can run in parallel after T023

**User Story 4** (LLM Handling):
- T027 (interface) before T028 (implementation)
- T029-T031 (error handling, timeout, short text) can run in parallel after T028
- T032-T035 (tests) can run in parallel after T031

**User Story 1** (Core Analysis):
- T036, T037, T038 can run in parallel (different services)
- T039 (route) after T037 (analysis service)
- T040 (server) after T039 (route)
- T041-T045 (tests) can run in parallel after T040

### Parallel Opportunities

**Foundational Phase** (after T006-T009 types complete):
```bash
# Can run in parallel:
T010 (config) + T011 (logger) + T012 (errors)
T013 (database) after T012 (needs error classes)
T014 (repository) after T013 (needs database)
```

**User Stories (after Foundational complete)**:
```bash
# All three can start in parallel:
Phase 3 (US2: Validation) - Team Member A
Phase 4 (US3: Persistence) - Team Member B  
Phase 5 (US4: LLM Handling) - Team Member C
```

**Within US1**:
```bash
# Can run in parallel:
T036 (keyword service) + T037 (analysis service) + T038 (queue middleware)
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (US2 + US3 + US4 + US1)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T005)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T006-T014) ← **CRITICAL BLOCKING GATE**
3. Implement US2: Input Validation (T015-T020) → Testable checkpoint
4. Implement US3: Persistence (T021-T026) → Testable checkpoint
5. Implement US4: LLM Handling (T027-T035) → Testable checkpoint
6. Implement US1: Core Analysis (T036-T045) → **MVP COMPLETE**
7. Test & verify all 4 user stories work independently
8. Deploy/demo MVP

### Incremental Delivery

Each phase represents a deployable increment:

1. **After US2**: Can validate and reject bad requests properly
2. **After US3**: Can store and retrieve data (even with mock analysis)
3. **After US4**: Can handle LLM integration with error recovery
4. **After US1**: Full end-to-end analysis capability (MVP!)
5. **After Concurrency**: Production-ready with load handling
6. **After Polish**: Fully documented and maintainable

### Parallel Team Strategy

With 3 developers:

1. All complete Setup + Foundational together (T001-T014)
2. Once Foundational done (after T014):
   - **Developer A**: US2 (T015-T020) - Input validation
   - **Developer B**: US3 (T021-T026) - Persistence
   - **Developer C**: US4 (T027-T035) - LLM handling
3. All come together for US1 (T036-T045) - Core integration
4. Test, validate, polish together

- [Story] label indicates which user story the task belongs to
- All user stories (US1-US4) are Priority P1 from spec.md
- Each user story is independently testable at its checkpoint
- Foundational phase (T006-T014) BLOCKS all user story work
- MVP is complete after T045 (all 4 user stories implemented)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate independently
