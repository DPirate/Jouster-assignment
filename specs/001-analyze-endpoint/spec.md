# Feature Specification: Analyze Endpoint

**Feature Branch**: `001-analyze-endpoint`
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "create specification for implementing analyze endpoint"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-22

- Q: What is the maximum allowed text length for the analyze endpoint? → A: 50,000 characters (approximately 10,000 words - long articles, reports)
- Q: How should the system handle text that is too short to meaningfully summarize? → A: Graceful degradation - for very short texts (fewer than 20 words), return the original text as the summary rather than forcing LLM processing or rejecting the request
- Q: What is the timeout threshold for LLM service requests? → A: 30 seconds (balanced timeout that handles most cases with reasonable wait time)
- Q: What should the system return for keywords when fewer than 3 nouns are found? → A: Return available nouns - empty array if none found, 1-2 items if partial (flexible, accurate representation)
- Q: Should the analyze endpoint require authentication? → A: No authentication - public endpoint (simplest, MVP-focused for prototype)
- Q: How should the system handle concurrent requests? → A: Queue with limit - process N concurrent requests, queue remainder up to max queue size; both N and max queue size configurable via environment variables (reasonable defaults: 10 concurrent, 100 max queue)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Submit Text for Analysis (Priority: P1)

A user submits unstructured text through the analyze endpoint and receives a comprehensive analysis including a concise summary and structured metadata (title, topics, sentiment, keywords).

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition of the system. The analyze endpoint is the primary interface for extracting insights from unstructured text. Without this, users cannot leverage LLM capabilities for content understanding.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by sending a POST request with sample text and verifying the response contains all required fields (summary, title, topics, sentiment, keywords). Delivers immediate value as a standalone text analysis tool.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has a blog post about technology trends, **When** they submit it to the analyze endpoint, **Then** they receive a 1-2 sentence summary, extracted title, 3 key topics, sentiment classification, and 3 most frequent nouns as keywords
2. **Given** a user submits a product review with clear positive language, **When** the analysis completes, **Then** the sentiment is correctly identified as "positive"
3. **Given** a user submits a technical article, **When** they receive the response, **Then** the keywords represent the 3 most frequent nouns found through custom extraction (not LLM-generated)
4. **Given** a user submits text without an obvious title, **When** the analysis completes, **Then** the title field is either extracted intelligently or left empty with no system error

---

### User Story 2 - Handle Invalid Input (Priority: P1)

A user accidentally submits empty, null, or malformed input to the analyze endpoint and receives clear, actionable error messages without system crashes.

**Why this priority**: Robustness is critical for production readiness. Poor error handling creates frustration and makes the system unreliable. Users need immediate feedback when they make mistakes.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by submitting various invalid inputs (empty string, null, missing fields, malformed JSON) and verifying appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages are returned.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user submits an empty text field, **When** the analyze endpoint is called, **Then** the system returns 400 Bad Request with message "Text input is required and cannot be empty"
2. **Given** a user submits a request with null text value, **When** the endpoint processes it, **Then** the system returns 400 Bad Request with a clear validation error
3. **Given** a user submits malformed JSON, **When** the request is received, **Then** the system returns 400 Bad Request with message "Invalid request format"
4. **Given** a user submits text exceeding 50,000 characters, **When** the request is processed, **Then** the system returns 413 Payload Too Large with message "Text exceeds maximum length of 50,000 characters"

---

### User Story 3 - Persist Analysis Results (Priority: P1)

After a successful analysis, the system automatically stores the complete analysis (original text, summary, metadata, timestamp) with a unique identifier so users can reference it later.

**Why this priority**: Persistence enables the search functionality and creates long-term value. Without storage, each analysis is lost after the response, making the system stateless and limiting its utility.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by submitting multiple analyses and verifying each receives a unique identifier and can be retrieved from storage. Delivers value by creating a queryable knowledge repository.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user submits text for analysis, **When** the analysis completes successfully, **Then** the system stores the result with a unique identifier and returns this ID in the response
2. **Given** multiple users submit different texts, **When** analyses complete, **Then** each receives a unique identifier with no collisions
3. **Given** an analysis is successfully stored, **When** retrieved from storage, **Then** all fields (text, summary, metadata, timestamp) are preserved exactly as generated
4. **Given** the database encounters a write error, **When** the analyze endpoint tries to persist, **Then** the system returns 500 Internal Server Error with message "Failed to store analysis" without crashing

---

### User Story 4 - Handle LLM Service Failures (Priority: P1)

When the LLM service is unavailable, times out, or returns invalid responses, the analyze endpoint handles the failure gracefully and provides meaningful feedback to users without system crashes.

**Why this priority**: External service failures are inevitable. The system must remain stable and provide clear communication when the LLM service has issues, maintaining user trust and enabling debugging.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by simulating LLM service failures (timeout, unavailable, malformed response) and verifying appropriate error responses with correct HTTP status codes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the LLM service is unavailable, **When** a user submits text for analysis, **Then** the system returns 503 Service Unavailable with message "LLM service temporarily unavailable, please try again later"
2. **Given** the LLM service times out during processing, **When** 30 seconds is exceeded, **Then** the system returns 504 Gateway Timeout with message "Analysis request timed out, please try again"
3. **Given** the LLM service returns malformed or incomplete data, **When** the response is processed, **Then** the system returns 500 Internal Server Error with message "Failed to process LLM response" and logs details for debugging
4. **Given** the LLM API key is invalid or expired, **When** the analyze endpoint makes a request, **Then** the system returns 503 Service Unavailable with message "LLM service authentication failed"

### Edge Cases

- When text contains only stopwords with no extractable nouns, keywords field returns empty array
- When text contains fewer than 3 distinct nouns, keywords field returns only the available nouns (1-2 items)
- How does the system handle text in non-English languages?
- What happens when text contains special characters, emojis, or unusual Unicode?
- For extremely short text (fewer than 20 words), the system returns the original text as the summary without LLM processing
- What happens when database storage is full or unavailable?
- System queues concurrent requests: processes N concurrent (configurable, default 10), queues remainder up to max queue size (configurable, default 100); requests exceeding queue capacity return 503 Service Unavailable
- What happens when extracted topics contain fewer than 3 distinct values?
- How does the system handle text with no discernible sentiment?
